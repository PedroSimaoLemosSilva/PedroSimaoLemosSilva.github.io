My name is Simão and I am 25 years old. I am a Junior iOS Developer and I love to make mobile apps.

I have worked in a couple of apps in my professional life and I also develop some apps in my free time as personal projects. 

I started at Farfetch, where I made my own "Marvel app" as an introduction to iOS and then I started working on the Farfetch iOS app itself, a luxury fashion marketplace app.

In the next project I work on, I became a developer in Cari iOS app, a food delivery app present in the middle east.

Currently I am working on a personal project, where I am developing a simple iOS game.
